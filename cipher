# Cipher (Snap Program)

This program was created in **Snap!**, a block-based programming language developed at UC Berkeley.

### Description
This is a simple encryption tool built in Snap!.  
Users can type a message, and the program transforms it using a basic substitution cipher.  
It demonstrates how text can be encoded and decoded using loops, lists, and string manipulation.

### What I Learned
- How substitution ciphers work  
- How to store and manipulate characters using **lists**  
- How to loop over each letter in a string  
- How to build interactive input/output blocks  
- How cryptography concepts can be simulated visually

### Features
- Input a custom message  
- Encrypt the message  
- Optionally decrypt it back  
- Animations and visual feedback
